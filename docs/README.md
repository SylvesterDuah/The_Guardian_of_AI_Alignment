AI Alignment

THE GUARDIAN OF AI ALIGNMENT!!🤯🤯 This project is a cutting-edge **Agentic Application** designed to monitor, evaluate, and ensure the alignment of deployed AI models with their intended goals and ethical guidelines. Built using **GraphRAG**, **ArangoDB**, **cuGraph**, and **LangChain**, this application acts as a **guardian system** for AI models, particularly in the **cybersecurity domain**.

---

🌟 Why This Project

As AI systems become more pervasive, ensuring their alignment with ethical and operational goals is critical. THE GUARDIAN😎 tackles this challenge head-on by:
- Monitoring AI Behavior: Detecting anomalies, biases, and deviations in real-time.
- Identifying Threats: Uncovering cybersecurity risks like adversarial attacks and data poisoning.
- Providing Actionable Insights: Offering recommendations to mitigate risks and ensure alignment.

🛠️ Features

🕵️‍♂️ AI Model Monitoring
- Track the behavior and outputs of deployed AI models in real-time.
- Detect anomalies, biases, or deviations from alignment goals.

🚨 Threat Detection
- Identify cybersecurity threats posed by AI models (e.g., adversarial attacks, data poisoning, or misuse).

� Graph-Based Knowledge Representation
- Use a graph to represent relationships between AI models, their training data, outputs, and potential threats.

💬 Natural Language Queries
- Ask questions like:
  - "Is Model X behaving as expected?"
  - "What are the potential risks of Model Y?"
  - "Which models are most vulnerable to adversarial attacks?"

⚡ Hybrid Query Execution
- Combines AQL (for graph traversal) and cuGraph (for analytics) to handle simple and complex queries.

📊 Real-Time Visualizations
- Interactive graphs and dashboards to visualize AI model behavior, threats, and alignment status.

📂 Dataset

This project uses the following datasets:
- Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVE): To map known vulnerabilities and threats.
- AI Incident Database: A collection of incidents involving AI systems.
- Synthetic Data: Simulated AI model behaviors and deviations for testing.

---

🧩 Graph Structure

The graph is structured as follows:
- Nodes:
  - AI Models (e.g., Model A, Model B).
  - Training Data (e.g., Dataset X, Dataset Y).
  - Outputs (e.g., Predictions, Decisions).
  - Threats (e.g., Adversarial Attacks, Data Poisoning).
  - Alignment Goals (e.g., Ethical Guidelines, Performance Metrics).
- Edges:
  - Relationships between models and their training data.
  - Connections between models and detected threats.
  - Links between outputs and alignment goals.
