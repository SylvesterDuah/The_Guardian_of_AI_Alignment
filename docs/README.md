THE GUARDIAN OF AI ALIGNMENT!! ü§Øü§Ø  
This project is a cutting-edge **Agentic Application** designed to monitor, evaluate, and ensure the alignment of deployed AI models with their intended goals and ethical guidelines. It acts as a **guardian system** for AI models‚Äîespecially within the **cybersecurity domain**‚Äîby leveraging graph-based knowledge representation, natural language queries, and real-time threat detection.

## üåü Why This Project

As AI systems become more pervasive, ensuring they operate safely and ethically is critical. **The Guardian** tackles this challenge by:

- **Monitoring AI Behavior:**  
  Detecting anomalies, biases, and deviations in real time.
  
- **Identifying Threats:**  
  Uncovering cybersecurity risks such as adversarial attacks, data poisoning, or misuse of deployed AI models.
  
- **Providing Actionable Insights:**  
  Offering recommendations, backed by AI ethics and governance references, to mitigate risks.

- **Alerting Companies:**  
  Notifying companies if third parties misuse their deployed AI (e.g., generating harmful content, using stolen API keys, or causing accidents).

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è AI Model Monitoring
- **Real-Time Analysis:**  
  Continuously monitor AI models' behavior via a remote ArangoDB graph.
  
- **Hybrid Query Execution:**  
  Combines AQL for graph traversal and cuGraph for analytics to answer natural language queries.

### üö® Threat & Misalignment Detection
- **Historical Analysis:**  
  Automatically checks for past misalignment incidents using both our graph and live tweet data.
  
- **Cybersecurity Alerts:**  
  Calculates risk scores, runs simulated vulnerability scans, and sends alerts if thresholds are exceeded.

### ÔøΩ Graph-Based Knowledge Representation
- Use a graph to represent relationships between AI models, their training data, outputs, and potential threats.

### üìä Live Monitoring Dashboard
- **Dynamic Visualizations:**  
  Interactive graphs and dashboards (similar to trading platforms) that display live alerts and activity trends.
  
- **Global Radar System:**  
  Aggregates data across sectors (e.g., healthcare, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, financial institutions, AI companies, individual projects) to provide a comprehensive risk report.

### ‚ö° Company-Specific Insights
- **Registration & Project Submission:**  
  Companies register with their name, password, company overview, and industry. They then submit their AI projects (description only), which are monitored for misalignment.
  
- **Live News & Tweet Integration:**  
  Integrates tweet data (using Tweepy) with graph queries to provide real-time news and social media sentiment related to company-specific AI incidents.
