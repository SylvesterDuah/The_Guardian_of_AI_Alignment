# Project Architecture

## Overview

This project is an interactive web application developed using Streamlit. Its primary purpose is to provide users with a platform to manage and visualize their projects. The application offers functionalities such as user authentication (registration and login), project creation, and data visualization. The goal is to deliver a user-friendly interface that simplifies project management and data analysis tasks.

## High-Level Components

The system is organized into the following main components:

1. **User Authentication Module**: Manages user registration and login processes to ensure secure access to the application.

2. **Project Management Module**: Allows authenticated users to create, view, and manage their projects.

3. **Data Visualization Module**: Provides tools for users to visualize project data through interactive charts and graphs.

4. **Session State Management**: Utilizes Streamlit's session state to maintain user-specific data across interactions.

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**:
   - Users register by providing necessary credentials.
   - Upon successful registration, they can log in to the application.

2. **Session Management**:
   - After login, user information is stored in Streamlit's session state to maintain the session across different pages and interactions.

3. **Project Management**:
   - Authenticated users can create new projects, which are stored in the application's database or data storage solution.
   - Users can view and manage their existing projects.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Users select a project to visualize its data.
   - The application processes the data and generates interactive visualizations for analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications in Python.
- **Streamlit-Authenticator**: Library for implementing user authentication within Streamlit apps.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: Creating interactive visualizations.

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Implementing User Authentication

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-02-15
- **Context**: To ensure secure access, the application requires user authentication.
- **Decision**: Integrated `Streamlit-Authenticator` to handle user registration and login processes.
- **Consequences**: Simplifies authentication implementation but requires secure management of user credentials.

### Decision 2: Managing Session State

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-02-20
- **Context**: The application needs to maintain user-specific data across interactions.
- **Decision**: Utilized Streamlit's `st.session_state` to store session-specific information.
- **Consequences**: Provides a straightforward method for session management but requires careful handling to avoid state inconsistencies.

## Future Considerations

- **Enhanced Security**: Implement additional security measures, such as password strength validation and account recovery options.
- **Scalability**: Optimize the application to handle a growing number of users and projects efficiently.
- **Feature Expansion**: Introduce collaborative project management features and advanced data analytics tools.
